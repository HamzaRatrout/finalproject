<pre id = "aboutUs">
	This website was created by two students from Code For Palestine 
who noticed that the students in this program don't know much about 
each other so the website aims to let the students in this program
to have a better chance of knowing more about each other. 

	Students, instructors and staff can create profiles and
inspect others'. They will know more about their hobbies 
and the website will give them a way to contact them
on Slack, Facebook and other websites.
